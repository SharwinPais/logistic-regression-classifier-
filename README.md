# Logistic Regression Classifier

This project implements a Logistic Regression model for binary classification using scikit-learn. The pipeline includes preprocessing (scaling numeric features), training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Data preprocessing using StandardScaler
- Logistic Regression classifier with `saga` solver
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix
